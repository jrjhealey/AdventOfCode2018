# AdventOfCode2018


Some (possibly not all) solutions to the coding challenges for 2018's Advent of Code - https://adventofcode.com/2018 (I need a real hobby).

Most of this is unlikely to be the fastest or most efficient way to get the job done, but may be among the prettier code, since I've amused myself with shiny colours and uncessary things.

Consequently, these aren't the shortest possible solutions (a la code golf) by a long shot, but it amused me so ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
